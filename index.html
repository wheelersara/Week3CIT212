                    <h1>Silicon Chip Implant Marvel</h1>
                    <p>A team of researchers led by Chandan Sen at the Indiana University School of Medicine, is moving 
                        a new nanochip device, which can reprogram skin cells in the body to become 
                        new blood vessels and nerve cells, out of the prototype phase.
                        Propelled by a focused electric charge, these genes are introduced to the desired depth in the living 
                        tissue and alter the cells, converting the location into a little bioreactor that reprograms the cells to become
                        different kinds of cells or multicellular structures, such as blood vessels or nerves, without the need for
                        elaborate laboratory techniques or hazardous virus transfer systems. Once produced, these 
                        cells and tissues can help to repair damage both locally or in other parts of the body, 
                        including in the brain.</p>

                    <h1>Legal Implications, IU School Of Medicine </h1>
                    <p> With new healthcare technology, comes legal implications. Unfortunately, doing this requires 
                        complicated laboratory procedures, and, along with many alternatives, can raise certain risks,
                        including giving rise to cancerous cells.Instead, a simpler system is needed 
                        that does not require the elaborate steps that stem cell perversion requires.</p>

                <h2>Other Areas of Research</h2>
                <p>The technology has been under development for over five years, and the IU team is now focusing on 
                    going beyond prototyping to making the nanochip a practical concern that can be used in clinical 
                    settings. This includes securing US FDA approval next year, which would open up the potential for 
                    clinical research in people. Potential applications in civilian and military medicine include 
                    repairing brain damage resulting from a stroke or reversing nerve damage caused by diabetes.</p>
